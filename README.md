Sim.Conn.Scenarios simulates relative abundace data from multiple sources and combines them into a simple relative abundace
index using the Conn (2010) method (https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/F09-175) implimented in STAN. You need both the 
.R and .Stan files in the same directory.

Sim.lm simulates simple linear regression data and fits the data using STAN.You need both the .R and .Stan files in the same directory.

EDM_tutorial.r is a brief tutorial running through the different non-linear, non-parametric time series analyses that can be done using Empirical Dynamic Modeling techniques using the rEDM package.
